## About SiPetta
SiPetta was created to solve complex problems in urban agriculture through efficient digital solutions. Agricultural land availability is an important challenge hindering the success of widespread urban farming initiatives and sustainable and efficient agriculture. Rapid urbanization and reduced land availability are hampering the growth of local food production and preventing communities from fully realizing the benefits of agriculture, especially in urban areas. Therefore, SiPetta is here to help urban agricultural practitioners and accommodate experts who want to participate in the sustainability of urban agriculture today actively. This solution is in line with the creation of sustainable and livable cities that prioritize local food production.
